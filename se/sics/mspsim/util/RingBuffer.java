 * 
 * An implementation of a synchronized queue backed by a ring buffer. This
 * functionality and implementation is similar to the ArrayBlockingQueue class,
 * but I thought that I'd implement my own version to get a better feel for how
 * it works.
 * 
 * A ring buffer is a space-efficient, locality-friendly implementation of a
 * FIFO queue. It is implemented as a fixed-sized array that is treated as
 * though it wraps around like a ring; it has no well-defined start or end
 * point. This array stores two pointers, a read pointer and a write pointer,
 * delineating where the next insert should take place and from where the next
 * element should be dequeued. For example:
 * 
 * [2] [3] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [0] [1] 
 *      ^                   ^ 
 *      |                   | 
 *    write                read
 * 
 * When using a ring buffer, one must be careful not to let the read and write
 * pointers cross one another. If this happens, future write operations will
 * start overwriting old elements that have not yet been consumed. For this
 * reason, most ring buffers adopt one of two strategies. First, the ring buffer
 * can increase its size whenever it runs out of room. This approach allows the
 * buffer to grow arbitrarily large if need be. The second option, and the one
 * used in this implementation, is simply to block on a read or write when data
 * is not available. This allows the ring buffer to implement the
 * producer/consumer pattern fairly easily; any number of threads can begin
 * creating data while some number of threads consume it, and at no time are too
 * many elements kept in memory waiting to be read.

		 * naive subtraction; that might end up giving us a negative index. To
		 * avoid this, we'll use a clever trick in which we'll add to the index
		 * the capacity minus the distance. This value must be positive, since the
		 * distance is never greater than the capacity, and if we then wrap this
		 * value around using the modulus operator we'll end up with a valid
		 * index. All of this machinery works because

		 * (x + (n - k)) mod n == (x - k) mod n
